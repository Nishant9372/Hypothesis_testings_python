# 📊 Hypothesis Testing in Python — Data Analyst Portfolio Project

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates the application of core statistical hypothesis testing techniques using Python. It is designed to showcase my ability to apply statistical reasoning to real-world business data, using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, and `seaborn`. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook format and includes both code and interpretation of results.

The project is part of my data analyst portfolio and reflects my proficiency in statistical testing, data wrangling, and drawing actionable insights from structured datasets.

## 📐 Statistical Tests Performed

This project includes the following hypothesis tests, each with real-world business questions, assumptions, Python implementation, and interpretation of results:

### 1. ✅ Z-Test
- **Use Case**: Determine if the average salary of employees in a department differs from a known population mean.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Population standard deviation is known.
  - Sample size is sufficiently large (n > 30).
- **Example**: Is the average salary in the IT department significantly different from $100,000?

### 2. ✅ T-Test
- **One-Sample T-Test**:
  - Compare the sample mean to a known value when population standard deviation is unknown.
- **Two-Sample T-Test**:
  - Compare means between two independent groups (e.g., Male vs. Female salaries).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Data is normally distributed.
  - Equal or unequal variances handled accordingly.
- **Example**: Do male and female employees earn significantly different salaries?

### 3. ✅ One-Way ANOVA
- **Use Case**: Compare mean salaries across more than two departments.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Independence of observations.
  - Homogeneity of variances.
  - Normally distributed groups.
- **Example**: Is there a significant difference in average salary among IT, Finance, and Sales departments?

### 4. ✅ Two-Way ANOVA
- **Use Case**: Assess the effect of two categorical variables (e.g., Gender and Department) on a continuous outcome (e.g., Salary).
- **Assumptions**:
  - Same as One-Way ANOVA, plus interaction effects.
- **Example**: Do gender and department jointly affect employee salaries?

### 5. ✅ Chi-Square Test of Independence
- **Use Case**: Test the relationship between two categorical variables.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Observations are independent.
  - Expected frequency in each cell is at least 5.
- **Example**: Is there an association between gender and employee exit status?

## 🧮 Detailed Test Insights

### 1️⃣ Independent T-Test (Salary vs Gender)
**Objective:** To test whether there is a significant difference in mean annual salary between male and female employees.  
**Result:**  
- *t-statistic = 2.80*, *p-value = 0.028*  
✅ **Reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
There is a **significant difference** in average salary between male and female employees.

---

### 2️⃣ Chi-Square Test (Department vs Gender)
**Objective:** To check whether gender distribution is independent of department assignment.  
**Result:**  
- *Chi² = 3.91*, *p-value = 0.688*  
❌ **Fail to reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
There is **no significant association** between gender and department — gender representation is fairly balanced across departments.

---

### 3️⃣ One-Way ANOVA (Salary vs Department)
**Objective:** To determine whether mean annual salary differs significantly across departments.  
**Result:**  
- *F-statistic = 7.02*, *p-value = 2.44e-07*  
✅ **Reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
There is a **significant difference** in mean salary among departments — some departments pay more than others.

---

### 4️⃣ Two-Way ANOVA (Salary vs Department & Ethnicity)
**Objective:** To analyze how department and ethnicity affect employee salary and to check for interaction effects.  

| Factor | F-value | p-value | Significance |
|:--------|:--------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Department | 6.81 | 4.36e-07 | ✅ Significant |
| Ethnicity | 1.24 | 0.29 | ❌ Not Significant |
| Interaction (Dept × Ethnicity) | 0.96 | 0.49 | ❌ Not Significant |

**Insights:**  
- Department has a **strong influence** on salary.  
- Ethnicity has **no significant effect**.  
- No interaction effect — salary differences across departments are consistent across ethnic groups.

---

### 5️⃣ One-Sample Z-Test (Average Age)
**Objective:** To determine whether the average employee age differs from a population average of 44 years.  
**Result:**  
- *z-statistic = 0*, *p-value = 1.0*  
❌ **Fail to reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
Average employee age (≈44 years) is **not significantly different** from the population average.

---

### 6️⃣ One-Sided Two-Sample Z-Test (IT vs Finance Salary)
**Objective:** To test whether IT department salaries are greater than Finance department salaries.  
**Result:**  
- *z-statistic = -4.42*, *p-value = 9.7e-06*  
✅ **Reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
Finance department has a **significantly higher average salary** than IT.  
(IT mean ≈ ₹97,790 vs Finance mean ≈ ₹122,803)

---

### 7️⃣ One-Sample Z-Test for Proportion (Gender)
**Objective:** To test whether the proportion of male employees is greater than 50%.  
**Result:**  
- Male proportion = 48.2%, *z = -1.14*, *p = 0.25*  
❌ **Fail to reject null hypothesis**

**Insight:**  
Proportion of male employees (48%) is **not significantly greater than 50%**, indicating **gender balance**.

---

## 🧭 Overall Findings

- **Department** is the **strongest factor** influencing salaries.  
- **Gender** has a measurable impact on salary levels.  
- **Ethnicity** does not significantly affect pay.  
- **No bias** is found in gender distribution across departments.  
- **Finance** employees earn significantly higher salaries than **IT** employees.  
- The company has a **balanced gender and age demographic** overall.
